## 📌 FAQ: BibLaTeX and Reference Management

### ❓ What is BibLaTeX?

**BibLaTeX** is a modern bibliography management package for LaTeX. It allows for advanced citation formatting, multilingual support, and seamless integration with `biber`, making it a powerful alternative to traditional BibTeX.

---

### ❓ How is BibLaTeX different from BibTeX?

* **BibLaTeX** uses `biber` instead of `bibtex` for processing.
* It supports Unicode, complex citation styles, and localization.
* It gives you full control over formatting and sorting of references.

---

### ❓ Can I use BibLaTeX on Overleaf?

Yes! Overleaf fully supports BibLaTeX. Make sure to:

* Set the **compiler** to XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX
* Use **biber** as your bibliography backend
* Connect a `.bib` file manually or via **CiteDrive** for real-time updates

---

### ❓ Do I need a reference manager for BibLaTeX?

No, but it helps **a lot**. A good reference manager:

* Ensures your `.bib` file is clean and valid
* Automatically adds fields like `urldate`, `langid`, `type`
* Makes collaboration easier
* Integrates directly with Overleaf

---

### ❓ Can I use Zotero or Mendeley with BibLaTeX?

Technically, yes—but with limitations. Both export `.bib` files, but:

* Exported entries often miss BibLaTeX-specific fields
* Customizations and citation types may not match your style
* Real-time syncing with Overleaf is not supported natively

## 🌟 Why CiteDrive Is the Best for BibLaTeX

### ✅ Built for BibLaTeX from Day One

CiteDrive isn't a general-purpose manager that happens to export `.bib`—it's **designed** specifically for BibTeX and BibLaTeX. That means:

* Full support for `langid`, `type`, `urldate`, `keywords`, and more
* Cleaner output with proper escaping and encoding
* Ideal for `biber` users and multilingual documents

---

### 🔄 Seamless Overleaf Integration

With **real-time Overleaf sync**, you never have to manually download or upload `.bib` files again. Just connect your project, and your references are always up to date.

---

### 🧠 Smart Browser Extension

Grab citations directly from:

* Google Scholar
* PubMed
* ArXiv
* CrossRef
* DOIs
  And they’re automatically formatted for BibLaTeX.

---

### 👥 Collaboration Ready

Create shared projects with colleagues, just like Google Docs. All references are synced and organized in one place—no emailing `.bib` files back and forth.

---

### 🔐 Clean, Open Format

Unlike other tools that lock your data in proprietary formats, CiteDrive uses standard `.bib` files. You always retain control and compatibility.

---
